\description{
Monthly data on monthly and annual commercial landings and value of Chinook salmon 
in WA, OR, N CA, and S CA assembled by the NOAA Fisheries, 
Fisheries Statistics Division
}
\details{
There are two datasets included:  chinook-month and chinook-year.  The monthly data are available from 1990 and the annual data are
available from 1950.  From the NOAA Fisheries Statistics Divison: "Collecting
 these data is a joint state and federal responsibility. 
 State-federal systems gather landings data from state-mandated fishery 
 trip-tickets, landing weighout reports from seafood dealers, 
 federal logbooks of fishery catch and effort, and shipboard and portside
interviews and biological sampling of catches. State fishery agencies are 
usually the main collectors of these data, though they and NOAA Fisheries 
gather data jointly in some states. Surveys are done differently 
in different states; NOAA Fisheries takes supplemental surveys to 
ensure that the data from different states and years are comparable."

In addition from NOAA Fisheries Statistics Division: 
"Statistics for each state represent a census of the volume and value of
finfish and shellfish landed and sold at the dock, not an expanded estimate
of landings based on sampling data. The main statistics collected are 
the pounds and ex-vessel dollar value of landings identified by species, 
year, month, state, county, port, water, and fishing gear. Most states 
get their landings data from seafood dealers who submit monthly reports 
of the weight and value of landings by vessel. Increasingly, though, 
states are getting landings data from mandatory trip-ticketsâ€”filled out 
by seafood dealers and fishermen at the end of every fishing trip, 
indicating their landings by species."
